k3c - Classic Docker for a Kubernetes world
===========================================

***STATUS: EXPERIMENT - Let me know what you think***

`k3c` is a local container engine designed to fill the same gap Docker does
in the Kubernetes ecosystem.  Specifically `k3c` focuses on developing and
running local containers, basically `docker run/build`. Currently `k3s`, the
[lightweight Kubernetes distribution](https://github.com/rancher/k3s),
provides a great solution for Kubernetes from dev to production.  While
`k3s` satisifies the Kubernetes runtime needs, one still needs to run
`docker` (or a docker-like tool) to actually develop and build the container
images.  `k3c` is intended to replace `docker` for just the functionality
needed for the Kubernetes ecosystem.

## A familiar UX

There really is nothing better than the classic Docker UX of `run/build/push/pull`.
This tool copies the same UX as classic Docker (think Docker v1.12). The intention
is to follow the same style but not be a 100% drop in replacement.  Behaviour and
arguments have been changed to better match the behavior of the Kubernetes ecosystem.
One change, for example, is that start/restart will always give you a fresh container
because pods in Kubernetes are always ephemeral.

## A single binary

`k3c`, similar to `k3s` and old school docker, is packaged as a single binary, because nothing
is easier for distribution than a static binary.

## Built on Kubernetes Tech (and others)

Fundamentally `k3c` is a built on the [Container Runtime Interface (CRI)](https://github.com/kubernetes/cri-api).  In fact it's really like a nicer version of
of [cri-tool](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cri-tools). CRI doesn't cover image building
and some other small image tasks like tag and push.  For image building Moby's [buildkit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit)
is used internally, and for other things OCI's [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd) is used.

## Architecture

`k3c` runs as a daemon either as root or one per user for rootless support.  **NOTE: rootless isn't currently
working, that's just the design right now**.  The daemon exposes a GRPC API.  For building the buildkit API is just
exposed directly from the k3c socket.  `containerd`, `buildkitd`, and `containerd-cri` are all embedded
directly into the k3c binary.

## Building

Builds are currently run via `k3c` if it is available on the $PATH otherwise `docker` is assumed to be available.

To build the `k3c` binary:

```bash
make build
```

To build the `k3c-data` image:

```bash
make package
```

## Running

Start the daemon as root (rootless will be supported in the future if this project takes off)
```bash
./bin/k3c daemon --group=$(id -g) --bootstrap-image=docker.io/rancher/k3c-data:dev
```

Run containers like you would with `docker`

```
$ ./bin/k3c --help

   help, h             Shows a list of commands or help for one command
```

## Roadmap

Right now this is just an experiment. If there is sufficient interest I expect I'll integrate
`k3s` + `k3c` + `k3os` + `k3d` to create a full `k3` end to end container solution that will
fully encompass all aspects of the container development life cycle.

Windows and macOS can be fully supported to in the future.
